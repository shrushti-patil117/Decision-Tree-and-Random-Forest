🌳 Decision Trees & Random Forest – AI & ML Internship Task 5

📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the AI & ML Internship Program.
The objective of this task is to understand and implement tree-based machine learning models for classification.

In this project, we:
Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
Visualized the decision tree
Analyzed overfitting by controlling tree depth
Trained a Random Forest Classifier
Compared model performance
Interpreted feature importance
Evaluated models using cross-validation

🎯 Objective
To learn and implement:
Decision Tree Algorithm
Random Forest Algorithm
Ensemble Learning
Feature Importance Analysis

Model Evaluation Techniques

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Graphviz
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset
For this task, we used the Heart Disease Dataset (or any relevant dataset).
The dataset contains medical attributes used to predict the presence of heart disease.

Example features:
Age
Sex
Chest Pain Type
Resting Blood Pressure
Cholesterol
Maximum Heart Rate
etc.

🚀 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Loaded dataset
Checked for missing values
Performed train-test split

2️⃣ Decision Tree Model
Trained DecisionTreeClassifier
Visualized tree using Graphviz
Controlled overfitting using:
max_depth
min_samples_split
min_samples_leaf

3️⃣ Random Forest Model
Trained RandomForestClassifier
Compared accuracy with Decision Tree
Observed performance improvement

4️⃣ Feature Importance
Extracted feature importance from Random Forest
Visualized important features

5️⃣ Model Evaluation
Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Cross-validation Score

📊 Results
Model	Accuracy
Decision Tree	XX%
Random Forest	XX%
(Random Forest typically performs better due to ensemble learning.)

🧠 Key Learnings
Decision Trees are easy to interpret but prone to overfitting.
Controlling tree depth helps reduce overfitting.
Random Forest reduces variance using bagging.
Feature importance helps understand influential variables.
Cross-validation gives more reliable model performance.
